<h1>Memory Mapped Files</h1>

There comes a time when you want to read and write to and from files so
that the information is shared between processes.  Think of it this way:
two processes both open the same file and both read and write from it,
thus sharing the information.  The problem is, sometimes it's a pain to
do all those <tt>fseek()</tt>s and stuff to get around.  Wouldn't it be
easier if you could just map a section of the file to memory, and get
a pointer to it?  Then you could simply use pointer arithmetic to get
(and set) data in the file.

<p>
Well, this is exactly what a memory mapped file is.  And it's really
easy to use, too.  A few simple calls, mixed with a few simple rules,
and you're mapping like a mad-person.
 
<h2>Mapmaker</h2>

Before mapping a file to memory, you need to get a file descriptor for
it by using the <tt>open()</tt> system call:

<p>
<pre>
    int fd;

    fd = open("mapdemofile", O_RDWR);
</pre>

<p>
In this example, we've opened the file for read/write access.  You can
open it in whatever mode you want, but it has to match the mode
specified in the <tt><i>prot</i></tt> parameter to the <tt>mmap()</tt>
call, below.

<p>
To memory map a file, you use the <tt>mmap()</tt> system call, which is
defined as follows:

<p>
<pre>
    void *mmap(void *<i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>, int <i>prot</i>, int <i>flags</i>,
               int <i>fildes</i>, off_t <i>off</i>);
</pre>

<p>
What a slew of parameters!  Here they are, one at a time:

<p>
<dl compact>
<dt><b><i>addr</i></b>
<dd>This is the address we want the file mapped into.  The best way to
use this is to set it to <tt><nobr>(caddr_t)0</nobr></tt> and let the OS
choose it for you.  If you tell it to use an address the OS doesn't
like (for instance, if it's not a multiple of the virtual memory page
size), it'll give you an error.
<p>

<dt><b><i>len</i></b>
<dd>This parameter is the length of the data we want to map into memory.
This can be any length you want.  (Aside: if <tt><i>len</i></tt> not a
multiple of the virtual memory page size, you will get a blocksize that
is rounded up to that size.  The extra bytes will be 0, and any changes
you make to them will not modify the file.)
<p>

<dt><b><i>prot</i></b>
<dd>The "protection" argument allows you to specify what kind of access
this process has to the memory mapped region.  This can be a bitwise-ORd
mixture of the following values: <tt>PROT_READ</tt>,
<tt>PROT_WRITE</tt>, and <tt>PROT_EXEC</tt>, for read, write, and
execute permissions, respectively.  The value specified here must be
equivalent to the mode specified in the <tt>open()</tt> system call that
is used to get the file descriptor.
<p>

<dt><b><i>flags</i></b>
<dd>There are just miscellaneous flags that can be set for the system
call.  You'll want to set it to <tt>MAP_SHARED</tt> if you're planning
to share your changes to the file with other processes, or
<tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt> otherwise.  If you set it to the latter, your
process will get a copy of the mapped region, so any changes you make to
it will not be reflected in the original file--thus, other processes
will not be able to see them.  We won't talk about <tt>MAP_PRIVATE</tt>
here at all, since it doesn't have much to do with IPC.
<p>

<dt><b><i>fildes</i></b>
<dd>This is where you put that file descriptor you opened earlier.
<p>

<dt><b><i>off</i></b>
<dd>This is the offset in the file that you want to start mapping from.
A restriction: this <b>must</b> be a multiple of the virtual memory page
size.  This page size can be obtained with a call to
<tt>getpagesize()</tt>.
</dl>

<p>
As for return values, as you might have guessed, <tt>mmap()</tt> returns
<tt>-1</tt> on error, and sets <tt>errno</tt>.  Otherwise, it returns a
pointer to the start of the mapped data.

<p>
Anyway, without any further ado, we'll do a short demo that maps the
second "page" of a file into memory.  First we'll <tt>open()</tt> it to
get the file descriptor, then we'll use <tt>getpagesize()</tt> to get
the size of a virtual memory page and use this value for both the
<tt><i>len</i></tt> and the <tt><i>off</i></tt>.  In this way, we'll
start mapping at the second page, and map for one page's length.  (On my
Linux box, the page size is 4K.)

<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

    int fd, pagesize;
    char *data;

    fd = fopen("foo", O_RDONLY);
    pagesize = getpagesize();
    data = mmap((caddr_t)0, pagesize, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, fd, pagesize);
</pre>
  
<p>
Once this code stretch has run, you can access the first byte of the
mapped section of file using <tt>data[0]</tt>.  Notice there's a lot of
type conversion going on here.  For instance, <tt>mmap()</tt> returns
<tt>caddr_t</tt>, but we treat it as a <tt>char*</tt>.  Well, the fact is
that <tt>caddr_t</tt> usually is defined to be a <tt>char*</tt>, so
everything's fine.

<p>
Also notice that we've mapped the file <tt>PROT_READ</tt> so we have
read-only access.  Any attempt to write to the data (<tt><nobr>data[0] =
'B'</nobr></tt>, for example) will cause a segmentation violation.
Open the file <tt>O_RDWR</tt> with <tt><i>prot</i></tt> set to
<tt>PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE</tt> if you want read-write access to the data.

<p>

<h2>Unmapping the file</h2>

There is, of course, a <tt>munmap()</tt> function to un-memory map a
file:

<p>
<pre>
    int munmap(caddr_t <i>addr</i>, size_t <i>len</i>);
</pre>

<p>
This simply unmaps the region pointed to by <tt><i>addr</i></tt>
(returned from <tt>mmap()</tt>) with length <tt><i>len</i></tt> (same as
the <tt><i>len</i></tt> passed to <tt>mmap()</tt>).  <tt>munmap()</tt>
returns <tt>-1</tt> on error and sets the <tt>errno</tt> variable.

<p>
Once you've unmapped a file, any attempts to access the data through the
old pointer will result in a segmentation fault.  You have been warned!

<p>
A final note: the file will automatically unmap if your program exits,
of course.

<h2>Concurrency, again?!</h2>

If you have multiple processes manipulating the data in the same file
concurrently, you could be in for troubles.  You might have to <a
href=flock.html>lock the file</a> or use <a
href=semaphores.html>semaphores</a> to regulate access to the file while
a process messes with it.  Look at the <a href=shmem.html#con>Shared
Memory</a> document for a (very little bit) more concurrency information.


<h2>A simple sample</h2>

Well, it's code time again.  I've got here a demo program that maps its
own source to memory and prints the byte that's found at whatever offset
you specify on the command line.

<p>
The program restricts the offsets you can specify to the range 0 through
the file length.  The file length is obtained through a call to
<tt>stat()</tt> which you might not have seen before.  It returns a
structure full of file info, one field of which is the size in bytes.
Easy enough.

<p>
Here is the source for <tt><a href=mmapdemo.c>mmapdemo.c</a></tt>:

<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
    #include &lt;errno.h&gt;

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        int fd, offset;
        char *data;
        struct stat sbuf;

        if (argc != 2) {
            fprintf(stderr, "usage: mmapdemo offset\n");
            exit(1);
        }

        if ((fd = open("mmapdemo.c", O_RDONLY)) == -1) {
            perror("open");
            exit(1);
        }

        if (stat("mmapdemo.c", &sbuf) == -1) {
            perror("stat");
            exit(1);
        }

        offset = atoi(argv[1]);
        if (offset &lt; 0 || offset &gt; sbuf.st_size-1) {
            fprintf(stderr, "mmapdemo: offset must be in the range 0-%d\n", \
                                                               sbuf.st_size-1);
            exit(1);
        }
        
        if ((data = mmap((caddr_t)0, sbuf.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_SHARED, \
                                                    fd, 0)) == (caddr_t)(-1)) {
            perror("mmap");
            exit(1);
        }

        printf("byte at offset %d is '%c'\n", offset, data[offset]);

        return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>
That's all there is to it.  Compile that sucker up and run it with some
command line like:

<p>
<pre>
    $ mmapdemo 30
    byte at offset 30 is 'e'
</pre>

<p>
I'll leave it up to you to write some really cool programs using this
system call. 

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

Memory mapped files can be very useful, especially on systems that don't
support shared memory segments.  In fact, the two are very similar in
most respects.  (Memory mapped files are committed to disk, too, so this
could even be an advantage, yes?)  With file locking or semaphores, data
in a memory mapped file can easily be shared between multiple processes.
