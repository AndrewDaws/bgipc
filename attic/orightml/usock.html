<h1>Unix Sockets</h1>

Remember <a href=fifos.html>FIFOs</a>?  Remember how they can only send
data in one direction, just like a <a href=pipes.html>Pipes</a>?
Wouldn't it be grand if you could send data in both directions like you
can with a socket?

<p>
Well, hope no longer, because the answer is here: Unix Domain Sockets!
In case you're still wondering what a socket is, well, it's a two-way
communications pipe, which can be used to communicate in a wide variety
of <i>domains</i>.  One of the most common domains sockets communicate
over is the Internet, but we won't discuss that here.  We will, however,
be talking about sockets in the Unix domain; that is, sockets that can
be used between processes on the same Unix system.

<p>
Unix sockets use many of the same function calls that Internet sockets
do, and I won't be describing all of the calls I use in detail within
this document.  If the description of a certain call is too vague (or if
you just want to learn more about Internet sockets anyway), please see
<a href=../net/>Beej's Guide to Network Programming Using Internet
Sockets</a> for more detailed information.

<h2>Overview</h2>

Like I said before, Unix sockets are just like two-way FIFOs.  However,
all data communication will be taking place through the sockets
interface, instead of through the file interface.  Although
Unix sockets are a special file in the file system (just like FIFOs),
you won't be using <tt>open()</tt> and <tt>read()</tt>--you'll be using
<tt>socket()</tt>, <tt>bind()</tt>, <tt>recv()</tt>, etc.

<p>
When programming with sockets, you'll usually create server and client
programs.  The server will sit listening for incoming connections from
clients and handle them.  This is very similar to the situation that
exists with Internet sockets, but with some fine differences.

<p>
For instance, when describing which Unix socket you want to use (that
is, the path to the special file that is the socket), you use a
<tt><nobr>struct sockaddr_un</nobr></tt>, which has the following
fields:

<p>
<pre>
    struct sockaddr_un {
        unsigned short sun_family;  /* AF_UNIX */
        char sun_path[108];
    }
</pre>

<p>
This is the structure you will be passing to the <tt>bind()</tt>
function, which associates a socket descriptor (a file descriptor) with
a certain file (the name for which is in the <tt>sun_path</tt> field).

<h2>What to do to be a Server</h2>

Without going into too much detail, I'll outline the steps a server
program usually has to go through to do it's thing.  While I'm at it,
I'll be trying to implement an "echo server" which just echos back
everything it gets on the socket.

<p>
Here are the server steps:

<ol>
<li><b>Call <tt>socket()</tt>:</b>  A call to <tt>socket()</tt> with the
proper arguments creates the Unix socket:

<p>
<pre>
    unsigned int s, s2;
    struct sockaddr_un local, remote;
    int len;

    s = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
</pre>

<p>
The second argument, <tt>SOCK_STREAM</tt>, tells <tt>socket()</tt> to
create a stream socket.  Yes, datagram sockets (<tt>SOCK_DGRAM</tt>) are
supported in the Unix domain, but I'm only going to cover stream sockets
here.  For the curious, see <a href=../net/>Beej's Guide to Network
Programming</a> for a good description of unconnected datagram sockets
that applies perfectly well to Unix sockets.  The only thing that
changes is that you're now using a <tt><nobr>struct
sockaddr_<b>un</b></nobr></tt> instead of a <tt><nobr>struct
sockaddr_<b>in</b></nobr></tt>.

<p>
One more note: all these calls return <tt>-1</tt> on error and set the
global variable <tt>errno</tt> to reflect whatever went wrong.  Be sure
to do you error checking.

<p>
<li><b>Call <tt>bind()</tt>:</b>  You got a socket descriptor from the
call to <tt>socket()</tt>, now you want to bind that to an address in
the Unix domain.  (That address, as I said before, is a special file on
disk.)

<p>
<pre>
    local.sun_family = AF_UNIX;  /* local is declared before socket() ^ */
    local.sun_path = "/home/beej/mysocket";
    unlink(local.sun_path);
    len = strlen(local.sun_path) + sizeof(local.sun_family);
    bind(s, (struct sockaddr *)&local, len);
</pre>

<p>
This associates the socket descriptor "<tt>s</tt>" with the Unix socket
address "<tt>/home/beej/mysocket</tt>".  Notice that we called
<tt>unlink()</tt> before <tt>bind()</tt> to remove the socket if it
already exists.  You will get an <tt>EINVAL</tt> error if the file
is already there.

<p>
<li><b>Call <tt>listen()</tt>:</b>  This instructs the socket to listen
for incoming connections from client programs:

<p>
<pre>
    listen(s, 5);
</pre>

<p>
The second argument, <tt>5</tt>, is the number of incoming connections
that can be queued before you call <tt>accept()</tt>, below.  If there
are this many connections waiting to be accepted, additional clients
will generate the error <tt>ECONNREFUSED</tt>.

<p>
<li><b>Call <tt>accept()</tt>:</b>  This will accept a connection from
a client.  This function returns <i>another socket descriptor</i>!  The
old descriptor is still listening for new connections, but this new one
is connected to the client:

<p>
<pre>
    len = sizeof(struct sockaddr_un);
    s2 = accept(s, &remote, &len);
</pre>

<p>
When <tt>accept()</tt> returns, the <tt>remote</tt> variable will be
filled with the remote side's <tt><nobr>struct sockaddr_un</nobr></tt>,
and <tt>len</tt> will be set to its length.  The descriptor <tt>s2</tt>
is connected to the client, and is ready for <tt>send()</tt> and
<tt>recv()</tt>, as described in the <a href=../net/#sendrecv>Network
Programming Guide</a>.

<p>
<li><b>Handle the connection and loop back to <tt>accept()</tt>:</b>
Usually you'll want to communicate to the client here (we'll just echo
back everything it sends us), close the connection, then
<tt>accept()</tt> a new one.

<p>
<pre>
    while (len = recv(s2, &buf, 100, 0), len > 0)
        send(s2, &buf, len, 0);

    /* loop back to accept() from here */
</pre>

<p>
<li><b>Close the connection:</b>  You can close the connection either by
calling <tt>close()</tt>, or by calling <tt><a
href=../net/#closedown>shutdown()</a></tt>.

</ol>

<p>
With all that said, here is some source for an echoing server, <tt><a
href=echos.c>echos.c</a></tt>.  All it does is wait for a connection on
a Unix socket (named, in this case, "echo_socket").

<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/un.h&gt;

    #define SOCK_PATH "echo_socket"

    int main(void)
    {
        int s, s2, t, len;
        struct sockaddr_un local, remote;
        char str[100];

        if ((s = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1) {
            perror("socket");
            exit(1);
        }

        local.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
        strcpy(local.sun_path, SOCK_PATH);
        unlink(local.sun_path);
        len = strlen(local.sun_path) + sizeof(local.sun_family);
        if (bind(s, (struct sockaddr *)&local, len) == -1) {
            perror("bind");
            exit(1);
        }

        if (listen(s, 5) == -1) {
            perror("listen");
            exit(1);
        }

        for(;;) {
            int done, n;
            printf("Waiting for a connection...\n");
            t = sizeof(remote);
            if ((s2 = accept(s, (struct sockaddr *)&remote, &t)) == -1) {
                perror("accept");
                exit(1);
            }

            printf("Connected.\n");

            done = 0;
            do {
                n = recv(s2, str, 100, 0);
                if (n &lt;= 0) {
                    if (n &lt; 0) perror("recv");
                    done = 1;
                }

                if (!done) 
                    if (send(s2, str, n, 0) &lt; 0) {
                        perror("send");
                        done = 1;
                    }
            } while (!done);

            close(s2);
        }

        return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, all the aforementioned steps are included in this
program: call <tt>socket()</tt>, call <tt>bind()</tt>, call
<tt>listen()</tt>, call <tt>accept()</tt>, and
do some network <tt>send()</tt>s and <tt>recv()</tt>s.

<h2>What to do to be a client</h2>

<p>
There needs to be a program to talk to the above server, right?  Except
with the client, it's a lot easier because you don't have to do any
pesky <tt>listen()</tt>ing or <tt>accept()</tt>ing.  Here are the steps:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Call <tt>socket()</tt> to get a Unix domain socket to communicate
through.
<p>
<li>Set up a <nobr><tt>struct sockaddr_un</tt></nobr> with the remote
address (where the server is listening) and call <tt>connect()</tt> with
that as an argument
<p>
<li>Assuming no errors, you're connected to the remote side!  Use
<tt>send()</tt> and <tt>recv()</tt> to your heart's content!
</ol>

<p>
How about code to talk to the echo server, above?  No sweat, friends, 
here is <tt><a href=echoc.c>echoc.c</a></tt>:

<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
    #include &lt;string.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/un.h&gt;
    
    #define SOCK_PATH "echo_socket"

    int main(void)
    {
        int s, t, len;
        struct sockaddr_un remote;
        char str[100];

        if ((s = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == -1) {
            perror("socket");
            exit(1);
        }

        printf("Trying to connect...\n");

        remote.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
        strcpy(remote.sun_path, SOCK_PATH);
        len = strlen(remote.sun_path) + sizeof(remote.sun_family);
        if (connect(s, (struct sockaddr *)&remote, len) == -1) {
            perror("connect");
            exit(1);
        }

        printf("Connected.\n");

        while(printf("&gt; "), fgets(str, 100, stdin), !feof(stdin)) {
            if (send(s, str, strlen(str), 0) == -1) {
                perror("send");
                exit(1);
            }

            if ((t=recv(s, str, 100, 0)) &gt; 0) {
                str[t] = '\0';
                printf("echo&gt; %s", str);
            } else {
                if (t &lt; 0) perror("recv");
                else printf("Server closed connection\n");
                exit(1);
            }
        }

        close(s);

        return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>
In the client code, of course you'll notice that there are only a few
system calls used to set things up: <tt>socket()</tt> and
<tt>connect()</tt>.  
Since the client isn't going to be <tt>accept()</tt>ing any incoming
connections, there's no need for it to <tt>listen()</tt>.  Of course,
the client still uses <tt>send()</tt> and <tt>recv()</tt> for
transferring data.  That about sums it up.

<p>
<h2><tt>socketpair()</tt>--quick full-duplex pipes</h2>

<p>
What if you wanted a <tt><a href=pipe.html>pipe()</a></tt>, but you
wanted to use a single pipe to send and recieve data from <i>both
sides</i>?  Since pipes are unidirectional (with exceptions in SYSV),
you can't do it!  There is a solution, though: use a Unix domain socket,
since they can handle bi-directional data.

<p>
What a pain, though!  Setting up all that code with <tt>listen()</tt>
and <tt>connect()</tt> and all that just to pass data both ways!  But
guess what!  You don't have to!

<p>
That's right, there's a beauty of a system call known as
<tt>socketpair()</tt> this is nice enough to return to you a pair of
<i>already connected sockets</i>!  No extra work is needed on your part;
you can immediately use these socket descriptors for interprocess
communication.

<p>
For instance, lets set up two processes.  The first sends a
<tt>char</tt> to the second, and the second changes the character to
uppercase and returns it.  Here is some simple code to do just that,
called <tt><a href=spair.c>spair.c</a></tt> (with no error checking for clarity):

<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;ctype.h&gt;
    #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

    int main(void)
    {
        int sv[2]; /* the pair of socket descriptors */
        char buf; /* for data exchange between processes */

        socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, sv);

        if (!fork()) {  /* child */
            read(sv[1], &buf, 1);
            printf("child: read '%c'\n", buf);
            buf = toupper(buf);  /* make it uppercase */
            write(sv[1], &buf, 1);
            printf("child: sent '%c'\n", buf);

        } else { /* parent */
            write(sv[0], "b", 1);
            printf("parent: sent 'b'\n");
            read(sv[0], &buf, 1);
            printf("parent: read '%c'\n", buf);
        }
        return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>
Sure, it's an expensive way to change a character to uppercase, but it's
the fact that you have simple communication going on here that really
matters.

<p>
One more thing to notice is that <tt>socketpair()</tt> takes both a
domain (<tt>AF_UNIX</tt>) and socket type (<tt>SOCK_STREAM</tt>).  These
can be any legal values at all, depending on which routines in the
kernel you want to handle your code, and whether you want stream or
datagram sockets.  I chose <tt>AF_UNIX</tt> sockets because this is a
Unix sockets document and they're a bit faster than <tt>AF_INET</tt>
sockets, I hear.

<p>
Finally, you might be curious as to why I'm using <tt>write()</tt> and
<tt>read()</tt> instead of <tt>send()</tt> and <tt>recv()</tt>.  Well,
in short, I was being lazy.  See, by using these system calls, I don't
have to enter the <i>flags</i> argument that <tt>send()</tt> and
<tt>recv()</tt> use, and I always set it to zero anyway.  Of course,
socket descriptors are just file descriptors like any other, so they
respond just fine to many file manipulation system calls.
