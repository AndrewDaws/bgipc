<h1>Message Queues</h1>

Those people who brought us System V have seen fit to include some IPC
goodies that have been implemented on various platforms (including
Linux, of course.)  This document describes the usage and functionality
of the extremely groovy System V Message Queues!

<p>
As usual, I want to spew some overview at you before getting into the
nitty-gritty.  A message queue works kind of like a <a
href=fifos.html>FIFO</a>, but supports some additional functionality.
Generally, see, messages are taken off the queue in the order they are
put on.  Specifically, however, there are ways to pull certain messages
out of the queue before they reach the front.  It's like cutting in
line.  (Incidentally, don't try to cut in line while visiting the Great
America amusement park in Silicon Valley, as you can be arrested for it.
They take cutting <i>very</i> seriously down there.)

<p>
In terms of usage, a process can create a new message queue, or it can
connect to an existing one.  In this, the latter, way two processes can
exchange information through the same message queue.  Score.

<p>
One more thing about System V IPC: when you create a message queue, it
doesn't go away until you destroy it.  All the processes that have ever
used it can quit, but the queue will still exist.  A good practice is to
use the <tt>ipcs</tt> command to check if any of your unused message
queues are just floating around out there.  You can destroy them with
the <tt>ipcrm</tt> command, which is preferable to getting a visit from
the sysadmin telling you that you've grabbed every available message
queue on the system.


<h2>Where's my queue?</h2>

<p>
Let's get something going!  First of all, you want to connect to a
queue, or create it if it doesn't exist.  The call to accomplish this is
the <tt>msgget()</tt> system call:

<pre>
   int msgget(key_t <i>key</i>, int <i>msgflg</i>);
</pre>

<tt>msgget()</tt> returns the message queue ID on success, or
<tt>-1</tt> on failure (and it sets <tt>errno</tt>, of course.)

<p>
The arguments are a little weird, but can be understood with a little
brow-beating.  The first, <tt><i>key</i></tt> is a system-wide unique
identifier describing the queue you want to connect to (or create).
Every other process that wants to connect to this queue will have to use
the same <tt><i>key</i></tt>.

<p>
The other argument, <tt><i>msgflg</i></tt> tells <tt>msgget()</tt> what
to do with queue in question.  To create a queue, this field must be set
equal to <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> bit-wise OR'd with the permissions for this
queue.  (The queue permissions are the same as standard file
permissions--queues take on the user-id and group-id of the program that
created them.)

<p>
A sample call is given in the following section.

<a name=ftok></a><h2>"Are you the Key Master?"</h2>

<p>
What about this <tt><i>key</i></tt> nonsense?  How do we create one?
Well, since the type <tt>key_t</tt> is actually just a <tt>long</tt>,
you can use any number you want.  But what if you hard-code the number
and some other unrelated program hardcodes the same number but wants
another queue?  The solution is to use the <tt>ftok()</tt> function
which generates a key from two arguments:

<pre>
    key_t ftok(const char *<i>path</i>, int <i>id</i>);
</pre>

Ok, this is getting weird.  Basically, <tt><i>path</i></tt> just has to
be a file that this process can read.  The other argument,
<tt><i>id</i></tt> is usually just set to some arbitrary char, like 'A'.
The <tt>ftok()</tt> function uses information about the named file (like
inode number, etc.) and the <tt><i>id</i></tt> to generate a
probably-unique <tt><i>key</i></tt> for <tt>msgget()</tt>.  Programs
that want to use the same queue must generate the same
<tt><i>key</i></tt>, so they must pass the same parameters to
<tt>ftok()</tt>.

<p>
Finally, it's time to make the call:

<pre>
    #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;

    key = ftok("/home/beej/somefile", 'b');
    msqid = msgget(key, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, I set the permissions on the queue to <tt>666</tt>
(or <tt>rw-rw-rw-</tt>, if that makes more sense to you).  And now we
have <tt>msqid</tt> which will be used to send and receive messages from
the queue.

<h2>Sending to the queue</h2>

Once you've connected to the message queue using <tt>msgget()</tt>, you
are ready to send and receive messages.  First, the sending:

<p>
Each message is made up of two parts, which are defined in the template
structure <tt><nobr>struct msgbuf</nobr></tt>, as defined in
<tt>sys/msg.h</tt>:

<pre>
    struct msgbuf {
        long mtype;
        char mtext[1];
    };
</pre>

The field <tt>mtype</tt> is used later when retrieving messages from the
queue, and can be set to any positive number.  <tt>mtext</tt> is the
data this will be added to the queue.

<p>
"What?!  You can only put one byte arrays onto a message queue?!
Worthless!!"  Well, not exactly.  You can use any structure you want to
put messages on the queue, as long as the first element is a long.  For
instance, we could use this structure to store all kinds of goodies:

<p>
<pre>
    struct pirate_msgbuf {
        long mtype;  /* must be positive */
        char name[30];
        char ship_type;
        int notoriety;
        int cruelty;
        int booty_value;
    };
</pre>

<p>
Ok, so how do we pass this information to a message queue?  The answer
is simple, my friends: just use <tt>msgsnd()</tt>:

<p>
<pre>
    int msgsnd(int <i>msqid</i>, const void *<i>msgp</i>, size_t <i>msgsz</i>, int <i>msgflg</i>);
</pre>

<tt><i>msqid</i></tt> is the message queue identifier returned by
<tt>msgget()</tt>.  The pointer <tt><i>msgp</i></tt> is a pointer to the
data you want to put on the queue.  <tt><i>msgsz</i></tt> is the size in
bytes of the data to add to the queue.  Finally, <tt><i>msgflg</i></tt>
allows you to set some optional flag parameters, which we'll ignore for
now by setting it to <tt>0</tt>.

</pre>

<p>
And here is a code snippet that shows one of our pirate structures being
added to the message queue:

<pre>
    #include <sys/msg.h>

    key_t key;
    int msqid;
    struct pirate_msgbuf pmb = {2, "L'Olonais", 'S', 80, 10, 12035};

    key = ftok("/home/beej/somefile", 'b');
    msqid = msgget(key, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);
  
    msgsnd(msqid, &pmb, sizeof(pmb), 0);  /* stick him on the queue */
</pre>

<p>
Aside from remembering to error-check the return values from all these
functions, this is all there is to it.  Oh, yeah: note that I
arbitrarily set the <tt>mtype</tt> field to <tt>2</tt> up there.
That'll be important in the next section.


<h2>Receiving from the queue</h2>

Now that we have the dreaded pirate <a
href=ftp://ftp.ecst.csuchico.edu/pub/beej/images/pirates/lolonais.jpg>Francis
L'Olonais</a> stuck in our message queue, how do we get him out?  As you
can imagine, there is a counterpart to <tt>msgsnd()</tt>: it is
<tt>msgrcv()</tt>.  How imaginative.

<p>
A call to <tt>msgrcv()</tt> that would do it looks something like this:

<p>
<pre>
    #include <sys/msg.h>

    key_t key;
    int msqid;
    struct pirate_msgbuf pmb; /* where L'Olonais is to be kept */

    key = ftok("/home/beej/somefile", 'b');
    msqid = msgget(key, 0666 | IPC_CREAT);

    msgrcv(msqid, &pmb, sizeof(pmb), 2, 0);  /* get him off the queue! */
</pre>

<p>
There is something new to note in the <tt>msgrcv()</tt> call: the
<tt>2</tt>!  What does it mean?  Here's the synopsis of the call:

<p>
<pre>
    int msgrcv(int <i>msqid</i>, void *<i>msgp</i>, size_t <i>msgsz</i>, long <i>msgtyp</i>, int <i>msgflg</i>);
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>2</tt> we specified in the call is the requested
<tt><i>msgtyp</i></tt>.  Recall that we set the <tt>mtype</tt>
arbitrarily to <tt>2</tt> in the <tt>msgsnd()</tt> section of this
document, so that will be the one that is retrieved from the queue.

<p>
Actually, the behavior of <tt>msgrcv()</tt> can be modified drastically
by choosing a <tt><i>msgtyp</i></tt> that is positive, negative, or
zero:

<p>
<center>
<table border=1>
<th><i><tt>msgtyp</tt></i> <th>Effect on <tt>msgrcv()</tt></th>
<tr>
<td align=center>Zero<td>Retrieve the next message on the queue,
regardless of its <tt>mtype</tt>.
<tr>
<td align=center>Positive<td>Get the next message with an <tt>mtype</tt>
<b>equal to</b> the specified <tt><i>msgtyp</i></tt>.
<tr>
<td align=center>Negative<td>Retrieve the first message on the queue
whose <tt>mtype</tt> field is less than or equal to the absolute value
of the <tt><i>msgtyp</i></tt> argument.
</table>
<b>Table 1.  Effects of the <tt><i>msgtyp</i></tt> argument on
<tt>msgrcv()</tt>.</b>
</center>

<p>
So, what will often be the case is that you'll simply want the next
message on the queue, no matter what <tt>mtype</tt> it is.  As such,
you'd set the <tt><i>msgtyp</i></tt> parameter to <tt>0</tt>.

<h2>Destroying a message queue</h2>

There comes a time when you have to destroy a message queue.  Like I
said before, they will stick around until you explicitly remove them; it
is important that you do this so you don't waste system resources.  Ok,
so you've been using this message queue all day, and it's getting old.
You want to obliterate it.  There are two ways:

<p>
<ol>
<li>Use the Unix command <tt>ipcs</tt> to get a list of defined message
queues, then use the command <tt>ipcrm</tt> to delete the queue.
<li>Write a program to do it for you.
</ol>

<p>
Often, the latter choice is the most appropriate, since you might want
your program to clean up the queue at some time or another.  To do this
requires the introduction of another function: <tt>msgctl()</tt>.

<p>
The synopsis of <tt>msgctl()</tt> is:

<p>
<pre>
    int msgctl(int <tt><i>msqid</i></tt>, int <tt><i>cmd</i></tt>, struct msqid_ds *<tt><i>buf</i></tt>);
</pre>

<p>
Of course, <tt><i>msqid</i></tt> is the queue identifier obtained from
<tt>msgget()</tt>.  The important argument is <tt><b>cmd</b></tt> which
tells <tt>msgctl()</tt> how to behave.  It can be a variety of things,
but we're only going to talk about <tt>IPC_RMID</tt>, which is used to
remove the message queue.  The <tt><i>buf</i></tt> argument can be set
to <tt>NULL</tt> for the purposes of <tt>IPC_RMID</tt>.

<p>
Say that we have the queue we created above to hold the pirates.  You
can destroy that queue by issuing the following call:

<p>
<pre>
    #include <sys/msg.h>
    .
    .
    msgctl(msqid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
</pre>

<p>

And the message queue is no more.
<p>

<h2>Sample programs, anyone?</h2>

For the sake of completeness, I'll include a brace of programs that will
communicate using message queues.  The first, <tt>kirk.c</tt> adds
messages to the message queue, and <tt>spock.c</tt> retrieves them.

<p>
Here is the source for <a href=kirk.c>kirk.c</a>:
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;

    struct my_msgbuf {
        long mtype;
        char mtext[200];
    };

    int main(void)
    {
        struct my_msgbuf buf;
        int msqid;
        key_t key;

        if ((key = ftok("kirk.c", 'B')) == -1) {
            perror("ftok");
            exit(1);
        }

        if ((msqid = msgget(key, 0644 | IPC_CREAT)) == -1) {
            perror("msgget");
            exit(1);
        }
        
        printf("Enter lines of text, ^D to quit:\n");

        buf.mtype = 1; /* we don't really care in this case */
        while(gets(buf.mtext), !feof(stdin)) {
            if (msgsnd(msqid, (struct msgbuf *)&buf, sizeof(buf), 0) == -1)
                perror("msgsnd");
        }

        if (msgctl(msqid, IPC_RMID, NULL) == -1) {
            perror("msgctl");
            exit(1);
        }

        return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>
The way <tt>kirk</tt> works is that it allows you to enter lines of
text.  Each line is bundled into a message and added to the message
queue.  The message queue is then read by <tt>spock</tt>.

<p>
Here is the source for <a href=spock.c>spock.c</a>:

<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    #include &lt;errno.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
    #include &lt;sys/msg.h&gt;

    struct my_msgbuf {
        long mtype;
        char mtext[200];
    };

    int main(void)
    {
        struct my_msgbuf buf;
        int msqid;
        key_t key;

        if ((key = ftok("kirk.c", 'B')) == -1) {  /* same key as kirk.c */
            perror("ftok");
            exit(1);
        }

        if ((msqid = msgget(key, 0644)) == -1) { /* connect to the queue */
            perror("msgget");
            exit(1);
        }
        
        printf("spock: ready to receive messages, captain.\n");

        for(;;) { /* Spock never quits! */
            if (msgrcv(msqid, (struct msgbuf *)&buf, sizeof(buf), 0, 0) == -1) {
                perror("msgrcv");
                exit(1);
            }
            printf("spock: \"%s\"\n", buf.mtext);
        }

        return 0;
    }
</pre>

<p>
Notice that <tt>spock</tt>, in the call to <tt>msgget()</tt>, doesn't
include the <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> option.  We've left it up to
<tt>kirk</tt> to create the message queue, and <tt>spock</tt> will
return an error if he hasn't done so.

<p>
Notice what happens when you're running both in separate windows and you
kill one or the other.  Also try running two copies of <tt>kirk</tt>
or two copies of <tt>spock</tt> to get an idea of what happens when you
have two readers or two writers.  Another interesting demonstration is
to run <tt>kirk</tt>, enter a bunch of messages, then run <tt>spock</tt>
and see it retrieve all the messages in one swoop.  Just messing around
with these toy programs will help you gain an understanding of what is
really going on.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

There is more to message queues than this short tutorial can present.
Be sure to look in the man pages to see what else you can do, especially
in the area of <tt>msgctl()</tt>.  Also, there are more options you can
pass to other functions to control how <tt>msgsnd()</tt> and
<tt>msgrcv()</tt> handle if the queue is full or empty, respectively.
